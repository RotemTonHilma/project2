            <h2>

                What it is: A much more strategic version of tic-tac-toe I learned from Math with Bad Drawings (he’s got
                a great explanation of the game, too)

                Best for: Two players

                What you need:

                Paper
                Something to write with

                How to play: OK, so we’re all familiar with tic-tac-toe, right? The normal 9-square grid?

                Well, in ultimate tic-tac-toe, you’ve got a smaller grid within each of those 9 squares:

                To win the game, you have to win three of the larger squares in a row, and to win a large square, you
                have to win three in a row in the smaller grid inside it.

                Here’s how it works. Say X goes first:

                Now, just like in normal tic-tac-toe, O gets to go. But O can’t just go anywhere. The smaller grid O
                must play in is determined by X’s move. So since X went in the bottom right corner within his small
                grid, O must go in the bottom right corner of the large grid:</h2>

            <h2>So O goes, anywhere in this small grid he wants to:</h2>

            <h2>Now you know where X has to go, right?</h2>

            <h2>See what just happened in the far right middle square? X got three in a row! That means X wins that
                small grid, thus claiming that square in the large grid:</h2>

            <h2>Then it’s O’s turn again (O is still sent to the small grid determined by X’s last move). Eventually
                someone will claim three small grids in a row, thus winning the whole game:</h2>

            <h2>ice job, X!

                As you can imagine, there’s a lot of strategy involved. You’ve got to keep in mind where you’re sending
                your opponent, thinking several moves ahead.

                One rule: If the player before you sends you to a grid that’s already been won, you get to go wherever
                you want. (So try not to send your opponent to an already-won grid!)

                Another rule you’ll need to decide on your own will be what to do with smaller grids that result in a
                tie. You could either count them for 1) neither X nor O or 2) both X and O. Try both ways and let me
                know which one you like more!

                Many thanks to Math with Bad Drawings for this fun and quite strategic game!</h2>
